# Description

Research by Elias Wedberg [@modernanalytica](https://twitter.com/modernanalytica)

Repo for archiving research and investigation related to the recent Trickbot leaks.

The repo will contain personally identifiable information of several Conti Ransomware & TrickBot operators released by twitter accounts TrickLeaks/ContiLeaks.

If you are interested in the backup of the information you can reaching out to me on Twitter or by opening issue.
